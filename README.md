# US Weather events damages

Exploration of the NOAA Storm Database.

The goal of the analyze is to compare events due to storm US like Tornado, Flood, Heat etc over the period : 1950 to 2011. First I analyze human damages (death and injuries) and I publish the top 10 events the more dangerous. Then I analyze the economics damages by weather disasters and again make a top 5 classification of the most important economic loss.

Let see the results on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/TanguyLevent/US_Storm_Impacts)
